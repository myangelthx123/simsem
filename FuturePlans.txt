New nonnormality tools:
- mnonr package
  - also provides Vale--Maurelli we already use
  - https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-019-01291-5
- covsim package
  - much more flexibility, costs computational efficiency
  - coauthor (with covsim authors) a vignette showing how to use vita() in
    custom function to pass to sim(..., generate=)
  - or custom function's output & pass to sim(..., rawData=)
    - example could be log-transforming nonnormal variable(s)


Need to make lavaaList() an option
- without gutting all of simsem? Or introducing probability of more errors?
- consider a new "simsemList" package that provides an interface to simply
  rely on lavaanList() functionality
  - simlavaanList(), with wrappers simcfaList() and simsemList() that call
    lavaanList() with FUN= and *List= arguments, return SimResult object
  - dataFunction= can do the work of both generate= and datafun=
    - generate= function can only have 1 argument (n=), but lavaanList() has dataFunction.args=
  - FUN= can do the work of outfun= (still need simsem for outfundata=)
